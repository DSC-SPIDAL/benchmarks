SPIDAL Project
==============

The goal for the SPIDAL project is to create software abstractions to
help connect communities together with applications in different
scientific fields, letting us collaborate and use other communitiesâ€™
tools without having to understand all of their details. The project
will integrate features of traditional high-performance computing, such
as scientific libraries, communication and resource management
middleware, with the rich set of capabilities found in the commercial
Big Data ecosystem. The latter includes many important software systems,
such as Hadoop, available from the Apache open source community.

At present one of our main goals is to establish a set of benchmarks for
Big Data analysis in the spirit of the Berkeley Dwarfs and NIST 2013 Big
Data Applications. Through the publication of several research papers in
the past year, we have sought to collect applications and their feature
and summarize key properties, followed by identifying and classifying
requirements with comparison to already established attributes like
those of NIST. Our work has culminated in the definition of around 50
essential features or 'facets' of Big Data that we call Ogres.

These Ogres are further divided into four distinct views: Problem
Architecture View (AV), Execution View (EV); Data Source and Style View
(DV), and Processing View (PV). The following table highlights the
different views and their corresponding facets.
